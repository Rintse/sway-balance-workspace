# sway-balance-workspace

A tool to balance a workspace, or a subset thereof (the current focus) in 
[sway](https://github.com/swaywm/sway). Heavily inspired by [i3-balance-workspace](https://github.com/atreyasha/i3-balance-workspace/blob/main/i3_balance_workspace/i3_balance_workspace.py).

# Usage
Build using `cargo build --release`. Use the `-f` argument to balance only the 
focus.
